When cheap smartphones and cellular data became ubiquitous in the 2010s in India, internet access exploded. It wasn’t an evolution but a revolution. India’s internet users grew from 100 million in 2010 to 400 million by 2015 and will top 600 million in 2020, according to the Internet and Mobile Association of India. This growth is almost entirely because of new and inexpensive smartphones which, for most Indians, serve as not only their first PCs and internet devices but also their first cameras, TVs, and alarm clocks. Put together, their impact has been transformative. The internet-enabled smartphone is eroding old Indian barriers of language, caste, class, gender, and geography in a way that was unimaginable just a few years ago. Thanks to voice-enabled smartphone technology, even the country’s 250 million illiterate men and women can now access the vast video and audio libraries on the internet.
